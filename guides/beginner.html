                <h3>Overview</h3> 
                <p>
                    The Beginner's Guide will take you through the overall process of game development, from conception of a game idea to post mortem of a project.
                    After reading this guide, you will have a better understanding of what you need to do to develop and  video game.

                <h3>What is a Video Game?</h3> 
                <p>
                    A Video Game is a digital interactive experience that is created by combining programming and art, where a set of rules govern how players can achieve a goal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Video Games can be a few squares jumping on rectangles, or a massive multiplayer online open world. 
                    Art can be as simple as a few pixels, or as complex as high poly models with photorealistic textures. 
                    Audio can be a few sound bites, or a grand composition played by an orchestra. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Games have been made by individuals, small groups, and large studios that span across the globe. 
                    With a plethora of tools, assets, and services available, anyone can make a video game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roles in game development include: engineers, producers, designers, artists, testers, composers, musicians, localizers, marketers, community managers, customer support, IT technicians, legal counselors, business administrators, accountants, facility managers, HR Reps, Recruiters, etc. 
                    All these people come together to build an experience the masses can enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Game ideas are created through brainstorming sessions then fleshed out through documentation and concept drawings. 
                    Once all developers agree on the game's design, a prototype built to validate it. 
                    As production of the game progresses, the game is iterated upon. More features are built, gameplay is tested and refined, finalized art and audio is added, and bugs are fixed. 
                    In order to ensure financial success, the game is marketed to its target audience to garner a potential player base. 
                    After months or years of hard work and dedication, the game is released.

                <h3>What Game Should I Make?</h3>
                <p>
                    Make the game you want to make.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some common starting points for a game idea include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Taking a proven game idea and innovate on top of it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reusing the same genre and mechanics from a game, but use them in a different setting.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Combining two or more genres to create a new experience that poses a different set of challenges.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Participating in Game Jams. Often, novel game ideas come from having to brainstorm around the proposed theme.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is your game a clone of a popular game but with a twist?
                    Or is it a completely original game idea?
                    Do you want to make a simple 2D platformer?
                    Or do you want to make an RPG with a bunch of items, cool weapons, deadly monsters, touching cinematics, heated action, grand story, and vast open world.
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    You can go headlong into making the game of your dreams, or start out by making smaller games and gradually build up your skills.                    
                    But don't underestimate how long it takes to make a game, even a small one. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use smaller projects as a learning experiece. By producing small games, you will more quickly grasp the game development process.
                    Smaller projects are more manageable, team members are more likely to stick around, and there is a greater chance the game will get finished and launch.
                    By failing quickly, you will be able to discover the best path for success.
                    As you complete more projects, you will gradually build up the experience and skills necessary to produce bigger games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are still set on making your big dream game your first game, then make sure to break it down into smaller chunks.
                    The feeling of progress will help with maintaining your motivation to work on projects that may take years to complete.
                    By accomplishing small goals, it becomes easier to achieve big goals.
                    If you dont feel confident that you can make your big dream game yet, then take a small fraction of the features from your big game idea to make your first small game.
                    If you are whole-heartedly commited to making your big dream game, then go for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that you've decided on the game you want to make, let's start conceptualizing it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="concept" class = "guide">
                <h3>Conceptualizing the Game Idea</h3>
                <p>
                    Start brainstorming and put your game idea on paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is your game's vision? What are your expectations of the player experience? What emotions do you want the experience to evoke from the players?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elaborate on all the higher level features of the game.
                    Jot down the theme, genre, goals, features, game pieces, game loop, progression, rewards, art style, type of music, target platform/s, etc.
                    Describe the setting, the game world, story, premise, lore, characters.
                    Make sketches of environments, levels, characters, and game objects to get a sense of scale and art direction.
                    Think about the audience your game is targeting and the experience you want them to have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that you have all the big ideas of your game on paper, the next step is to evaluate the game's scope.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="scope" class = "guide">
                <h3>Managing Scope</h3>
                <p>
                    Scope equates to a gameâ€™s complexity.
                    The more features and content a game has, the greater the game's scope.
                    By evaluating the scope, we can determine estimate the production time for a game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Start by determining your game's Minimum Viable Product (MVP), the minimum finished state the game needs to be in before it can ship.
                    The MVP includes both the all essential features that makes up the game (mechanics and systems), and the content the game has to offer (characters, levels, art, audio, etc).
                    From the MVP, determine what a Vertical Slice of the game would look like.
                    The Vertical Slice is a demo that contains all of the in-game core features and the minimal amount of content needed to represent a majority of the experiences a player can expect.
                    The rest is then categorized as Additional Features and Content. The sum of the game's scope is the Desired Product.
                    Your production timeline should be: Vertical Slice, the Minimum Viable Product, then Desired Product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because video games are an artistic endeavor, designs are subject to change.
                    Features need to be built and tested, then refined based on player feedback.
                    Player feedback has a huge impact how heavily the game's design will change.
                    Features that looked good on paper may turn out to be horrible and result in a bad gameplay experience.
                    If a feature is not fun, then designs need to be adjusted to improve it, new designs need to be made to replace it, or the feature set is scrapped entirely.
                    Features may turn out to be too complex for your team to implement, so simplified or alternative designs will have to be introduced.
                    Even bugs and glitches can potentially become features or may lead to design changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During any redesign phase, you will need to re-evaluate the scope to make sure any changes do not severely impact your production timeline.
                    Avoid Feature Creep, which is the tendency to add a lot of new features and content to the game's design over the course of development.
                    Team members often over-estimate their production capacity, and forget how much work there still is for completing the MVP.
                    Avoid this by making sure any design changes to the MVP are minimal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to design changes, set backs, and production constraints, the game you originally envisioned isn't always going to be the game that gets shipped.
                    Your team will have to make tough decisions on what features and content to keep or cut.
                    Anything that is cut might be cut from production entirely, or set aside as a post-launch update.
                    With the advent of "Early Access" releases and the "Games as a Service" business model, developers will often continue to provide Content Updates long after a game has been released.
                    Content Updates and patches may include new features, add new content to existing features, tune gameplay after reviewing player feedback, and fix bugs discovered by the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that you've narrowed down the scope of the game idea and are committed to making your game, let's start elaborating on the details.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="gdd" class = "guide">
                <h3>Writing a Game Design Doc</h3>
                <p>
                    A Game Design Document is the central document that contains all the design details of a game. It functions as a written blueprint and can be as broad or in-depth as necessary. At the very least, it should contain all the high level design and technical details of your game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use the notes from your Game Concepting session to outline the Game Design Doc. Elaborate on all of the rules, mechanics, systems, game objects, functionality, interfaces, control schemes, and game options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solidify the art style and list out the necessary 3D models, 2D graphics, textures, animations. Determine the level design and the necessary environments, lighting, shaders, post processing, and particle effects. Draw some concept art of the game and create references of the world establish a more cohesive theme and aesthetic of environments, set pieces, scale of the world, props, characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flesh out the lore, world building, story beats, plot, narrative, script, and character interactions. Storyboard  scenes and cinematics of key plot points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Figure out what music and the sound effects are necessary for menus, actions, or event sequences. Layout the User Experience and User Interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the GDD should contain the most recent agreed upon design of the game and serve as a reference during development. But, it is very likely design will change after several sessions of prototyping, playtesting, and discussing. As a result, the GDD will evolve as designs are iterated upon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With your game design and scope set for now, how are you going to make your game? What are the necessary tools to make your design a reality?

                <h3>Tools and Assets FAQs</h3>
                <p>
                    Q: What Engine, Frameworks, Libraries, APIs, SDKs, Programming Languages, and Tools do I use?<br>
                    A: It does not matter what tools you use to make your game. Pick the tools that will make developing your game easier. If you know what type of game you are making, find a toolset that is tailored for making your game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q: Iâ€™ve never programmed before and want to make games. Where do I start?<br>
                    A: Learn to program while making your game with a Game Engine. There are tons of tutorials and documentation for introductory game engine programming. Google search for tutorials on how to program game mechanics or systems. Search for questions you have in forums or on Q/A hubs, it is very likely someone else has already asked them. If you can't find the answer you are looking for, then post a question in the Q/A hubs or forums.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q: Are there other ways to program without wanting to learn a programming language?<br>
                    A: Some engines use visual scripting systems to make it easier for designers and artists to program game logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q: I want to make a game, but I donâ€™t want to program it. What do I do?<br>
                    A: Team up, hire, or contract a programmer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q: I'm using a general-purpose Game Engine, and I donâ€™t want to spend time programming key game systems. What should I do?<br>
                    A: Purchase plugins for an engine from their respective marketplace or asset store. Many people work on extending the functionality of an engine to save others time and speed up the development process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q: Should I build my own Game Engine / Framework for making my game?<br>
                    A: No. If you want to be a game developer, make games. Do not make a Game Engine. An Engine is a tool to make game creation easier. Some engines are general-purpose, and provide a standard set of tools and functions to create any type of game. Other engines are specialized and come equipped with tools to make a game for a specific genre. If an engine lacks the functionality you need, modify the engineâ€™s source code or create a plugin. 
                    Only make a game engine if all the available tools arenâ€™t suitable for making your game, if you want a specialized tool to make your game, if you plan on reusing your engine to make sequels or similar games, if you want to be a professional Engine Programmer, or if you are adamant about avoiding royalties for using a company's engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q: I donâ€™t want to make the art and audio for my game. Where can I get assets? <br>
                    A: For unique and custom assets, team up with an artist, hire an artist, contract a freelancer, or contract an asset creation service. Alternatively, you can purchase art assets from digital marketplaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q: Are there free tools and assets?<br> 
                    A: There are plenty of free tools and assets available for download. Most game engines are free so you can start development right away. A lot of asset creation tools are free or offer free trials. There are also many websites that provide free assets for anyone to use to make games.

                <h3>Team Size and Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    The teamâ€™s skill level will determine whether or not implementing certain features is feasible and if it can be done in a timely manner. Inexperienced team members may result in poor implementation of complex features, or could lengthen development time as they learn new skills and gather the necessary knowledge. Whereas, experienced members likely already know how to build the required systems and have an easier time expanding upon them. Production time will also be more predictable and move at a steadier pace with a more experienced team.

                <p>
                    If you are a solo dev, then production time is entirely decided by you. Every aspect of the game will require your attention. You will be knowledgeable in multiple areas, but the trade off is that you will not be specialized into one discipline. As a result, production times will drastically increase because all tasks will have to be performed sequentially. But, you have full creative control of your game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a team of specialized individuals, tasks can be divided up and completed in parallel. Multiple tasks can be finished during each iteration cycle, allowing the team to build prototypes of the game faster. Smaller teams will still require members to complete tasks in several departments, but still allow development to move faster than a solo developer. Also, you must give up creative control to those in charge of their particular department.

                <h3>Recruiting Team Members</h3>
                <p>
                    If you plan on making your game with a team, first decide on what roles you want to play in the project. Once you have accepted responsibility for a specific set of tasks, determine what tasks are still available and what roles and how many people are needed to cover them. Once you know what roles need to be filled, recruit members to your project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several websites, subreddits, forums, and discord servers where teams advertise their projects and individuals advertise their services. The more details you provide about your project and the available jobs, the more likely people will inquire and join your team. Describe the premise, the genre, the roles that are available, what each role is responsible for, the estimated production time, and minimum time commitment per week. Alternatively, you can attend local game developer meetups and ask attendees if they are interested in working on your project. Both industry professionals and hobbyists attend these meetings. If you are having trouble recruiting people, then contract freelancers to work on your game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do consider that people are less inclined to contact you about your project if you require them to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before divulging any of the game ideas. The lack of information about the project will inhibit your ability to recruit the right individuals for your team. People become skeptical when they don't know what you are getting them into and will likely result in wasted time for both parties during the interview process. An NDA is a good way to keep your business a secret, but what good is a secret game idea if you canâ€™t recruit the right people to make it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Factors to consider while recruiting members are experience, compensation, location, time zone, and availability. Less experienced individuals will be willing to work for free, but may lead to slower production. More experienced individuals will expect payment for their high skill labor, especially if your project requires a significant time commitment. Try to recruit people locally or in the same time zone. The greater the difference between each team member's time zone, the more delayed communication can be. If you are willing to work remotely with individuals scattered across the globe, you can do that too. Just keep in mind that global remote teams take a lot of effort to manage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To ensure that people complete their assigned tasks, you can use task management software and assign tasks to individuals and give them a deadline to complete the task.

                <h3>Production and Task Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that you have a game design doc and a team, it is now time to set up production, create tasks, and assign them out to team members. Games development is a lot like Modern Software Development, it is an iterative development process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most common software development methodology used today is Agile. The premise is to make software with a focus on end user experience and feedback. Reviewing the state of the product periodically and evaluating where changes and improvements are necessary. Production is flexible and open to rapid change in design. Through continuous iteration and collaboration, the product evolves and becomes better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your first goal should be to make a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)? To validate your game concept, you need to build and play a prototype of your game as soon as possible. Schedule your first set of tasks to prioritize making the MVP. Identify what are the minimum systems and mechanics for your game. Determine the dependencies of key features and layout what order in which things need to be built. The sooner you have an early prototype, the sooner you will be able to reaffirm your gameâ€™s design and verify if the game is actually fun to play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People are lazy and tend to put things off. So set deadlines for each task. Make a goal, or milestone, of what your team should accomplish every month or so. Then, break out the tasks that are required to complete that goal. Make daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly deadlines for each task and assign them out to the appropriate team members. Have goals and meet those goals by the arbitrary due date. Setting deadlines holds team members accountable and keeps production moving at a steady pace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep in mind, work quality varies from person to person. In small teams, most individuals are dedicated to one role, so the quality of work in a department is dependent on one person. But in studios, teams are made up of multiple engineers and artists. Regardless of the team size, production needs to make sure everyone is being held to the same quality standards. Code might need to meet certain performance and scalability requirements. Art might need to be made in a consistent style so the environment and game objects blend together seamlessly. Audio is the right fit for the world and is of a certain fidelity. Peer review helps maintain the overall quality of the work.                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the  milestone, you will want to review the teamâ€™s progress and evaluate production. Was the complexity of a task not estimated correctly and wasnâ€™t finished by the deadline? Will certain features take longer to implement than originally anticipated? Is a team member slacking off? Do team members finish their work early and have nothing left to do for the remainder of the milestone? Will the original planned release date need to be pushed back? Did team members leave the project? Do we need to recruit more members to achieve a higher production velocity? Taking the time to review the gameâ€™s production will help predict the results of the next milestone and allow you to better plan out the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a variety of task management applications available to help facilitate production of any sort. Some are as simple as paper TODO lists, sticky note scrum boards, or digital issue lists and kanban boards. Others are more complex and can encompass every aspect of production, from departments, scheduling, velocity, complexity, feature criteria, task lists, dashboards, etc. Use the system that works best for you and fits your needs.

                <p>
                    Ask yourself, what are the costs to develop your game? Costs include both time and money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What skills are needed to develop the game? How long will it take to learn the necessary skills to develop the game? Will you make the game by yourself? Do you need a team? How will you compensate your teammates? What tools will you use? Do you need licenses for software? What assets will you need? Do you need servers to host your game? What is the build pipeline? What distribution platforms are you targeting?

                    How will you fund the project? All projects require funding. Whether itâ€™s to hire other professionals, or to just keep the lights on. Most people have a day job and only have their evenings and weekends available to contribute to a project. Most people will not dedicate themselves full-time to a game project without compensation. Everyone needs to pay for expenses, and it's difficult to work on something full-time without financial security. If you want to go full-time, make sure you have the available funds to do so.

                <h3>Funding Options</h3>
                <p>
                    If you want to work full-time on your game, there are several funding options available. These include: using your savings, starting a crowdfunding campaign, partnering with publishers or investors, or applying for developer grants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For crowdfunding, publishing, and grants, you will be required to pitch your game to whomever you are seeking investment from. You will want to be able to show a solid concept, often a working prototype, detailed design descriptions, captivating screenshots or videos, a definite production deadline, a breakdown on how the money will be spent, and what will be the potential Return on Investment (monetary or product). The more clear cut and detailed your pitch is, the greater your chances of success.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe the ROI is the experience you gained from completing the project. Your new found knowledge can be put to use in other projects, and it can help advance your career, business, or hobbies.

                    What price will you sell your game at? What platforms will you target? Do you expect monetary gain from sales and/or publishers/investors? What revenue model will you use? Will you also include microtransactions or a subscription? Do you plan to expand the game with free or paid DLC?
                </p>
                <p>
                    But if you release a game for free and expect monetary gain, what approach will you take? Sell cosmetic goods? Sell in-game currency that can be used to purchase rolls at a gacha, or speed up actions to reduce waiting? Sell boosters to alleviate the amount of grinding a player has to do to progress? Have a subscription that gives players rewards for their participation?

                <p>
                    For live services, how do you maintain player retention? How do you reward players and encourage them to keep playing? Do you create daily, weekly, monthly objectives? Do you host limited timed events? Do you make 1 time achievements that become increasingly more difficult?

                    Who is your target audience? Are you targeting a general audience that likes action or fps titles? Or is your audience more niche and into psychological horror? Either way you need to know who your audience is and make sure to direct your marketing towards them. You can do some market research and get an estimate on the market size based on the sales of previous titles within the same genre. From there you can predict expected sales projections or growth of the user base and revenue.

                <h3>Marketing and Release</h3>
                <p>
                    Marketing and advertising is critical to a game's success. The goal is to convert as many people within your target audience into buyers. Your team can make the most amazing game possible, but if nobody knows about it, then no one will play it. There are multiple avenues to spreading the word about your game and itâ€™s development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a publisher, they will assist your studio with traditional marketing and advertising of your game through games media outlets. Today, social media is the most common grassroots strategy to build up hype and grow an audience. Post devlogs, make screenshots and gifs, show game trailers, tell friends and family, launch a crowdfunding campaign, upload demo builds, or partnering with Letâ€™s Players to showcase your game. Word of mouth is powerful and has the potential to make your game go viral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For multiplayer testing, you can host Alpha and/or Beta Testing of your game. That way, fans of your game can play the game early and give you feedback before itâ€™s released. You can use their feedback to resolve any connectivity issues and to iterate or rebalance the gameplay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By marketing you can grow a community/following around your game. Getting people on the hype train and increasing chances of potential buyers. Hold active discussions in forums or live streams to build community growth and engagement. You will be able to gauge the size of the market for your game and better predict the success of your title.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is the potential for your game to go viral simply on the word-of-mouth generated after a game is released without any marketing. But if you want to ensure your game has a successful launch, market it before, after, and when it releases.

                <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
                <p>
                    Youâ€™ve finished your game and released it to market. Sales numbers are rolling in and you see a surge of active users. Your team gets word from the community of various bugs and glitches in the game to iron out. The critics and users write reviews and provide feedback. Before your team continues work on the next set of patches and content drops, spend some time reflecting on the projectâ€™s success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Post Mortems are meant to be a learning opportunity for team members. This is when you ask questions such as: Did the team meet the original production deadlines, and if not why? Did you reach your projected sales goals? How was the game received by the audience? What development processes could be improved upon? What mistakes were made that can be avoided in the future? Was the team satisfied with the work they did and did it meet quality expectations? Is there any work that was completed that can be reused for future projects? Does the team feel like they can continue working together on future projects?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Itâ€™s important to learn from your mistakes and for everyone to provide constructive criticism. Nobody is perfect, and there is plenty of room for people to grow. Take what you learned and apply it to improve the outcome of future projects.
